# App Ideas

Some ideas for apps you may want to build.


## Location based Todo List

Skill level: #intermediate
Tags: #mobile #location #social

Transform [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) into an augmented reality location-based app.

Imagine you're driving past the grocery store. Your phone buzzes, notifying you that the store is tagged with todo items. You glance at your phone and see a shopping list in TodoMVC.

* [ ] This should be a universal app. Rendering, data management, & routing should use the same code for both NodeJS & clients
* [ ] Use the [universal-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/cloverfield-tools/universal-react-boilerplate) as the starting point for your app
* [ ] Post your project on GitHub, and open a pull request with a link to your project
* [ ] Use [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for native mobile UI
* [ ] Use [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to select locations on the map
* [ ] Use React, [react-stampit](https://github.com/stampit-org/react-stampit)
* [ ] Use [cerebral](https://github.com/christianalfoni/cerebral) or [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux) for in-memory state management
* [ ] Use [relay & graphql](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/02/20/introducing-relay-and-graphql.html) for data queries
