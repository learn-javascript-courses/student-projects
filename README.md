### rtype

#### [Runtime rtype parser](https://github.com/ericelliott/rtype/issues/62) #advanced

You'll learn about how programming language compilers parse source code, extract its meaning, and compile output from it.

Write a function that takes an rtype interface description as a string and returns an object that can be used for runtime type checking.

```js
parseSignature(signature: String) => {
  checkInputs: Predicate,
  checkOutput: Predicate,
  checkError: Predicate
}
```

The target function will get wrapped by a utility such as [rfx](https://github.com/ericelliott/rfx). When the wrapper function gets called, it will pass inputs to `checkInputs()`. If it returns true, only then does the original function get called. When the function returns, its output will be similarly checked by `checkOutput()` before it gets returned to the original caller. If the function throws, the error will also be checked, by `checkError()`.
