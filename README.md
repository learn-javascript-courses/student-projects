# Student Projects

A list of open source projects that students can contribute to for student projects. Please feel free to join an existing project and collaborate. All your contributions to any project you've collaborated on will count toward your student achievements.

## Library Projects

### react-pure-component-starter

#### [Update ESLint](https://github.com/ericelliott/react-pure-component-starter/issues/196) #easy

ESLint has deprecated some old rules. Bring the `.eslintrc` up to date with the current rule names. Run `npm run lint` to spot failures, and correct the error messages.


### rtype

#### [Runtime rtype parser](https://github.com/ericelliott/rtype/issues/62) #advanced

Experience with compilers, type theory, language design would be helpful.

Write a function that takes an rtype interface description as a string and returns an object that can be used for runtime introspection and type checking.

Useful background:

* The [Stanford Compilers course](https://www.coursera.org/course/compilers) (free online lectures)

If you're curious about types, see the [introduction to types](https://class.coursera.org/compilers/lecture/45) from the Stanford Compiler course.


## App Projects

### [CheckIn](https://github.com/learn-javascript-courses/checkin) #intermediate

A simple app to keep track of what people on your teams are working on.
