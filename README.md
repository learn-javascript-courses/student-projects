## react-pure-component-starter

### [Update ESLint](https://github.com/ericelliott/react-pure-component-starter/issues/196) #easy

ESLint has deprecated some old rules. Bring the `.eslintrc` up to date with the current rule names. Run `npm run lint` to spot failures, and correct the error messages.


## rtype

### [Runtime rtype parser](https://github.com/ericelliott/rtype/issues/62) #advanced

Write a function that takes an rtype interface description as a string and returns an object that can be used for runtime introspection and type checking.
